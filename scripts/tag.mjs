// tag.mjs — the language-neutral tagging capability shared by every language

// owns its lexicon/morphology/word-order (or case-feature/free-word-order,
// isolating-morphology, dictionary-segmentation, etc.) law; communicating
// owns Mark admission, articulation, charged settlement, roles and
// cohomology; this module is the mechanism each fiber shares in between:
// compile the bundle, tokenize, per-word POS tag, and run the full
// construe→descend→fold settlement pipeline to produce tagText's
// per-sentence parse+roles+cohomology.
